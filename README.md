# Bike Sharing analysis 

## Overview of Project
For this project a webpage and dynamic table were created to filter results of alien and UFO contacts based on date. The challenge is to refactor the code in app.js and index.html to allow for additional filtering. The final product is a web page that could filter table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
