# Bike Sharing analysis 

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to convince investors that the bike sharing program in De Moins is a solid business proposal. To achieve that end, a bike trip analysis is laid out in the form of a Tableau story.  The story will contain visualizations that show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and gerners, as well as the number of bike trips for riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week. There will also be additional visualizations showing the number of bike trupos for each type of user and gender for each day of the week in the form of heat maps. Two additional visualizations that will also be helpful are maps of the top starting/ending locations as well as the number of riders by gender throughout days of the month. The final presentation will be collected in the dashboards and summarized in the Tableau story.

## Bike Sharing Summary

The visualized trips show that bike trips generally last between 10-20 minutes, the second graph also shows that the majority of those using this service are males. The top starting/ending locations reveals that the business is centered in Manhattan, specifically around residential and business districts, with a few outliers in Brooklyn and little to no representation in the other boroughs. An additional visualization that would be useful is a pie chart containing data on how many riders are subscribers vs one time users, which would give indication on repeat business vs tourists. Another idea is to map the areas where bike repairs are most frequently needed as that would save time and manpower down the line if repair locations can be consolidated where the majority of the traffic is.
